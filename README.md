## 🧠 Abstract

The *WaterWise* app aims to empower users by providing easy access to vital information on water quality, consumption, and environmental impact. It combines real-time monitoring with educational resources to enhance water literacy and promote sustainable practices. The app includes customizable displays, goal-setting tools, social media integration, and gamification elements to engage users in water conservation efforts.

## 📝 Paper Overview

This research explores the current challenges in water monitoring—such as sensor reliability, data security, and real-time analysis—and proposes *WaterWise* as a user-centered mobile application designed to address them. It emphasizes iterative design, user feedback, environmental impact assessment, and cross-platform accessibility.

Key contributions include:
- Comparative review of existing water monitoring tools
- Application design grounded in Agile and User-Centered Design
- Evaluation based on usability testing and data analysis
- Recommendations for expanding functionality and impact
